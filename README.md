<h3>Cipher algorithms with Python üêçüîè</h3>

</div>

## What is this

PyCipher is a collection of cipher algorithms written in `python`.

Currently it includes the following ciphers and their tests:
- Caesar
- Vigenere

## Inspiration

Cryptography was always interesting to me, this is my hands-on with it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `python`
- For running the tests you need `unittest`

## Getting pycipher

To get pycipher, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/pycipher
cd pycipher
```

## Using pycipher

The source of the ciphers are kept under `src` you can import these into other modules for use.
Unit tests are under the `test` directory.

## How it was built

pycipher was built using `VS Code`, `python` and `unittest`.

## Challenges faced

Getting VS Code to recognize the tests was tricky, had to add empty `__init__.py file.`

## What I learned

- Setting up `unittest` in VS Code.
- Different cipher algorithms.

## What's next

Add more ciphers.
